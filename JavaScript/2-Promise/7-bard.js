// Prompt: Content of JSON file will be return without parsing but you
// parse string literal, why don't just use object literal for default value
// Reply: You are correct, the content of the JSON file will be returned
// without parsing. The reason I parsed the string literal is because I wanted
// to make sure that the default value was a valid JSON object. If I had used
// an object literal, there is a chance that it could have been invalid JSON
// and would have caused an error.
//
// Here is the optimized version of the code using an object literal for
// the default value:

const fs = require('node:fs').promises;

const config = await fs.readFile('config.json', 'utf8') || { port: 80 };

console.log({ config });
